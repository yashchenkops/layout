        p.about__message
          | It is a worldwide blockchain ecosystem that brings together several cutting-edge technologies, including NFT and fintech. You are aware that the cryptocurrency business has entered a new phase with endless opportunities for growth with the introduction of non-fungible tokens. As a result, we are combining two massive ecosystems, namely fintech and NFT finance, to develop a new form of blockchain bank system. Earnings for ecosystem referrals are generated using revenues from the sale of NFT collectibles, which in turn are used to support the further growth of the world's first NFT bank. The Exodus algorithm idea is founded on a complex blockchain algorithm. Our ecosystem serves this goal by providing storage for NFTs as well as an exchange for NFTs, which makes it far simpler to use and provides a user-friendly interface.

        +accordion-item("<h3>I'm interested in purchasing multiple NFTs, can I?</h3>")
          | Yes, You Can!
        +accordion-item("<h3>If I were to purchase an NFT and then give it as a present to someone else, would the new owner be able to use it immediately to take part in the referral system that was built on it already?</h3>")
          | Like any asset on the blockchain, the NFT can be passed around BUT! The referral system is tied to your wallet; thus, the present will include only the NFT with no referrals on it! 
        +accordion-item("<h3>How many referrals I can add to my tree /or trees?</h3>")
          | There is no limit on how many referrals can be behind you! Neither behind your first second and third-step referrals! There is a possibility to build huge nets of passive income together with the Exodus algorithm!
        +accordion-item("<h3>Will the NFT, which currently is in my wallet, also can be put up for sale?</h3>")
          | Yes of course but there is no logic in doing so, better go and get some referrals!
        +accordion-item("<h3>When can I withdraw my rewards for bringing referrals?</h3>")
          | Whenever you will withdraw you can! There are NO FEES from our side! 
        +accordion-item("<h3>Is it possible to get freaking rich with Exodus?</h3>")
          | We bet you can! 
        +accordion-item("<h3>Is there a possibility for the project to block the withdrawal function?</h3>")
          | No, such a thing cannot happen since the smart contract is deployed and cannot be changed along the way.

          +accordion-item("<h3>How the DAO system will work?</h3>")
            | Each NFT grants its holder a vote qualification, with every additional NFT the holder’s number of votes increases. There would be many options for the voters to choose from and all options will be discussed after the first round of sales.
          +accordion-item("<h3>Is there a possibility that I can withdraw more than I spent initially?</h3>")
            | Of course! This is the concept of the project.
          +accordion-item("<h3>Can I use another wallet rather than using Metamask?</h3>")
            | You can use any wallet that has integration with the Binance Smart Chain and is eligible for usage with Web 3 Dapps.
          +accordion-item("<h3>When the Exodus Card will be released?</h3>")
            | TBA, the Exodus Card is under development and will be released as soon as possible but only after all tests and verifications have been conducted.
