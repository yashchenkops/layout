        p.about__message
          | It is a worldwide blockchain ecosystem that brings together several cutting-edge technologies, including NFT and fintech. You are aware that the cryptocurrency business has entered a new phase with endless opportunities for growth with the introduction of non-fungible tokens. As a result, we are combining two massive ecosystems, namely fintech and NFT finance, to develop a new form of blockchain bank system. Earnings for ecosystem referrals are generated using revenues from the sale of NFT collectibles, which in turn are used to support the further growth of the world's first NFT bank. The Exodus algorithm idea is founded on a complex blockchain algorithm. Our ecosystem serves this goal by providing storage for NFTs as well as an exchange for NFTs, which makes it far simpler to use and provides a user-friendly interface.

With the same concept, this works with the next 2 referral levels. When the first referral of the third one in the chain buys the NFT you will get another 5%.
