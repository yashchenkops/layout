        p.about__message
          | It is a worldwide blockchain ecosystem that brings together several cutting-edge technologies, including NFT and fintech. You are aware that the cryptocurrency business has entered a new phase with endless opportunities for growth with the introduction of non-fungible tokens. As a result, we are combining two massive ecosystems, namely fintech and NFT finance, to develop a new form of blockchain bank system. Earnings for ecosystem referrals are generated using revenues from the sale of NFT collectibles, which in turn are used to support the further growth of the world's first NFT bank. The Exodus algorithm idea is founded on a complex blockchain algorithm. Our ecosystem serves this goal by providing storage for NFTs as well as an exchange for NFTs, which makes it far simpler to use and provides a user-friendly interface.

            | After your initial purchase there is a need to refer to your link for an invitation to secure your tree of cashback. You can build limitless branches of cashback in the process by inviting more and more referrals.

            | Your first referral will buy the NFT and you get 20% from their initial purchase when they refer their referral to buy the NFT they get 20% back like you did but also there is a 10% distribution back to you! With the same concept, this works with the next 2 referral levels. When the first referral of the third one in the chain buys the NFT you will get another 5%.

          li.how-it-works__li
            span 4. 
            | There is no limit on how many referrals you can invite on the first level â€“ this means you can build enormous trees of cashback that will reward you daily with passive income! The algorithm of Exodus is secured, transparent, verified, and signed by the smart contract.

      +accordion()
        +accordion-item("<h3>How much will a member get for referring new members?</h3>")
          | For the first two referrals, the participant receives 100% from each, starting from the third, 50% for each new participant. The referral program only works to&nbsp;attract new members to&nbsp;the first level.
        +accordion-item("<h3>If I buy more NFTs in the same level, will another queue open?</h3>")
          | No. You will simply have more NFTs. One NFT is&nbsp;enough to&nbsp;participate in&nbsp;the program. You can buy NFT as&nbsp;a&nbsp;gift.
        +accordion-item("<h3>Can I buy the 5th level immediately without going through the other levels below?</h3>")
          | It&nbsp;will be&nbsp;possible to&nbsp;buy Level 5&nbsp;NFTs on&nbsp;the secondary market. You can mint NFT by&nbsp;levels strictly sequentially. In&nbsp;order to&nbsp;mint level 5&nbsp;NFTs, you must have NFTs of&nbsp;the first 4&nbsp;levels in&nbsp;your wallet.
        +accordion-item("<h3>If I buy an NFT from level 2 and give it as a gift, will the new owner be able to take part in level 2 right away with it?</h3>")
          | No. Ownership of&nbsp;NFT tokens of&nbsp;all previous levels will be&nbsp;checked. If&nbsp;the wallet of&nbsp;the new owner contains NFT level&nbsp;1, he&nbsp;will be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;activate the 2nd level and join the queue.
        +accordion-item("<h3>If I join the tier 2 queue and sell my only tier 2 NFT, will I still be in the queue?</h3>")
          | You will remain in&nbsp;line, but you will not receive the money. Your reward will go&nbsp;into the system.
        +accordion-item("<h3>Will my place in the queue be sold along with the NFT?</h3>")
          | No.

        .faq__hidden-blocks
          +accordion-item("<h3>Can I withdraw money from my balance while in the queue?</h3>")
            | You can withdraw all available funds on&nbsp;your balance at&nbsp;any time. Information about your balance and a&nbsp;button for withdrawing all money from it&nbsp;are available in&nbsp;your Personal Account.
          +accordion-item("<h3>Can I partially withdraw money?</h3>")
            | No. You can only withdraw the entire amount on&nbsp;your balance.
          +accordion-item("<h3>What do I need to do to get in line?</h3>")
            | In&nbsp;the first level, you need to&nbsp;buy a&nbsp;level 1&nbsp;NFT and earn a&nbsp;qualification. You will automatically be&nbsp;placed in&nbsp;a&nbsp;queue after qualifying.
          +accordion-item("<h3>How to get a qualification?</h3>")
            | You may get qualification by&nbsp;referring two new level 1&nbsp;NFT buyers or&nbsp;doing a&nbsp;turbo boost (buy without attracting buyers at&nbsp;double price of&nbsp;level&nbsp;1).
          +accordion-item("<h3>How to get into the queue of the next level?</h3>")
            | To&nbsp;get to&nbsp;the next level, you need to&nbsp;have passed the qualification in&nbsp;the first level and have the NFT of&nbsp;the previous levels.
